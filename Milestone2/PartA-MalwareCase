Malware Case Analysis – Case Project 3-4: Banning Ransomware Payments

Case Summary (Project 3-4)
Case Project 3-4 examines recent legislative proposals in several U.S. states that would prohibit government agencies from paying ransomware demands. The reasoning is that attackers would no longer target
these agencies if they knew payments were impossible, and overall ransomware activity would decline because paying only encourages more attacks. Some policymakers have suggested extending the ban to all 
organizations, including private businesses. The project challenges us to evaluate whether banning payments would actually stop ransomware, and to consider what happens to victims who cannot recover their
systems through backups.

Malware Classification & Infiltration Method -
Ransomware is classified as a form of malware that encrypts or locks user data and demands payment for decryption. Most ransomware infiltrates systems through common methods such as:

Phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.

Exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched software.

Compromised remote access (RDP brute-force or stolen credentials).
In the case of attacks on state and local governments, phishing and unpatched software are particularly common, since public agencies often operate with limited IT staff and outdated infrastructure.

Impact Analysis -
If a ransomware ban extended to senior centers, healthcare providers, or local agencies that serve seniors, the consequences could be significant:

Loss of Critical Services – Clinics or agencies could lose access to scheduling, prescriptions, or records, directly impacting seniors’ health and benefits.

Personal Data Loss – Seniors could lose sensitive data (such as Social Security info, tax documents, or medical files) if systems are not recoverable.

Increased Anxiety and Exploitation – Seniors are already frequent targets of scams. A ransomware incident could be leveraged by attackers to extort or scare individuals further, especially if recovery is not
possible.

Mitigation Strategies -

Robust Backup Systems – Agencies and organizations must maintain frequent, encrypted, and offline backups to ensure data recovery without paying ransoms.

Patch and Update Policies – Regular updates for operating systems, software, and network devices close the vulnerabilities most often exploited by ransomware.

User Security Awareness Training – Teaching employees and community members (including seniors) how to recognize phishing attempts and suspicious attachments reduces the likelihood of infection.

Why This Matters to My Service Learning Project -
My service learning project is focused on helping seniors detect phishing scams. Since phishing is one of the main delivery methods for ransomware, showing seniors how to recognize and avoid suspicious emails 
directly reduces their exposure to ransomware threats. Discussing the policy debate over banning ransom payments emphasizes the importance of prevention: if victims cannot pay, then awareness, backups,
and proactive defense are the only protections left. Helping seniors understand these risks not only supports their safety but also reinforces the broader community’s resilience against ransomware.
