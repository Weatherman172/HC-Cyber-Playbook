An Ethernet switch is a type of network hardware that is foundational to networking and the internet. Ethernet switches connect cabled devices, like computers, Wi-Fi access points, PoE lighting and IoT devices,
and servers, in an Ethernet LAN so they can communicate with each other and to the internet.

Ethernet technology is designed to solve the problem of packet collision in a shared network by having network-connected devices follow a set of rules that allow devices to talk to each another without talking over
each other. These network-connected devices are physically connected with a cable to an Ethernet switch that then manages the flow of data between devices, applications, data, cloud services and the internet. 
More formally, Ethernet is a common name for the IEEE 802.3 standard based on the Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol, which defines when to transmit and what is to happen if a
collision is detected, as well as endpoint addressing, transmission speeds, and media. The IEEE 802.3 media standards focus on cable type (coaxial, twisted-pair and fiber), bandwidth capacity (10 Mbps to Tbps) and
transmission distance.

From a user perspective, an access Ethernet connection requires a physical cable and provides a dedicated link from the switch to the end device with bandwidth up to the speed of the connected port.
Wi-Fi connections are wireless and allow devices to be located anywhere that can receive a Wi-Fi signal but share the bandwidth of the connecting Wi-Fi access point with other devices connected to the same AP.

 Most modern Ethernet switches are capable of handling both types of data-forwarding tasks in a network environment. However, by design, routers are better suited to managing a high volume of data traffic quickly
 and efficiently. 

 Ethernet switches connect multiple devices together by physically cabling those devices to the same switch or devices connected to another switch that is connected the same network.These cables include coaxial, 
 fiber, and Ethernet cable twisted-pair.
Once a device is connected to a port, the Ethernet switch manages the flow of data between the device and other devices, applications, data, cloud services, and the internet. The switching process directs incoming
and outgoing data to the correct port on the switch based on the port of the sending device and the sending and destination MAC addresses.The MAC address of both sender and destination are included, with the data 
being sent in an Ethernet frame.

T568A and T568B are the color codes used for wiring eight-position RJ45 modular plugs. The only difference between T568A and T568B is the order in which the wires connect to the RJ45 jack. In T568A, the green wires
connects to pins 1,2 and the orange wire connects to pins 3,6. In T568B, the orange wires connects to pins 1,2 and the green wires connects to pins 3,6. All the other wires connect to the same pins in both 
standards.
