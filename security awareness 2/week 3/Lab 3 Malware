Malware Type

Instructions: 
Identify and define the malware discussed in your selected Chapter 3 Case/Hands-On Project.


Response:

A logic bomb is a type of malware that remains dormant until a specific condition or trigger event is met.

Infection Method & Symptoms

Instructions: 
Explain how the malware spreads and what symptoms appear on an infected system.


Response:

Logic bombs have many ways they spread, including insider placement, compromised software updates, infected files or binaries, removable media, and privilege escalation. Common symptoms include sudden data corruption or deletion, unexpected changes to critical configuration files or binaries, unexpected process execution, and network anomalies. 

Evidence

Instructions: 
Insert notes, screenshots, or log excerpts collected during the guided lab.


Response:

There was no guided lab.

Defenses & Mitigations

Instructions: 
List at least three concrete defenses or countermeasures.


Response:

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and Code Signing
Change Management and Access Control
Behavioral Monitoring and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) 

NetAcad Linkage

Instructions: 
Explain how this connects to NetAcad Modules 2.1–2.2 (Analyzing a Cyber Attack, Methods of Infiltration).


Response:

This connects to NetAcad Modules 2.1-2.2 by showing what types of symptoms appear with different types of malware. The symptoms of a logic bomb are similar to other types of malware that were shown on NetAcad 2.2. These symptoms include modified or deleted files and unknown processes running.
