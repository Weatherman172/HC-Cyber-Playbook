Definitions and notes
IOT - The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical devices, such as sensors, appliances, vehicles, and industrial machines, that are embedded with software and connectivity capabilities. These devices collect, share, and analyze data over the internet, enabling automation, smarter decision-making, and enhanced efficiency.
The McCumber cube - The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them
CIA triad - The CIA triad is a foundational model in cybersecurity, representing the three core principles that guide how organizations protect their data and systems: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three pillars serve as the baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of security controls and the overall resilience of an organization's information security posture.
•	Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals.
•	Integrity protects data from being altered or tampered with—whether maliciously or accidentally.
•	Availability ensures that systems, services, and data are accessible to users when they need them.
White hat attackers - break into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
Gray hat attackers may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.
Black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.
Cyberwarfare - is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.
Malware -  Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to or compromise a system. 
Spyware - Designed to track and spy on you, spyware monitors your online activity and can log every key you press on your keyboard, as well as capture almost any of your data, including sensitive personal information such as your online banking details. Spyware does this by modifying the security settings on your devices. It often bundles itself with legitimate software or Trojan horses.
Adware - Adware is often installed with some versions of software and is designed to automatically deliver advertisements to a user, most often on a web browser. You know it when you see it! It’s hard to ignore when you’re faced with constant pop-up ads on your screen. It is common for adware to come with spyware.
Backdoor - This type of malware is used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication procedures to access a system. As a result, hackers can gain remote access to resources within an application and issue remote system commands. A backdoor works in the background and is difficult to detect.
Ransomware - This malware is designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a payment is made. Ransomware usually works by encrypting your data so that you can’t access it. Some versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock it down. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails that encourage you to download a malicious attachment or through a software vulnerability.
Scareware - This is a type of malware that uses 'scare’ tactics to trick you into taking a specific action. Scareware mainly consists of operating system style windows that pop up to warn you that your system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to return to normal operation. If you agree to execute the specific program, your system will become infected with malware.
Rootkit - This malware is designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers can then use to access your computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to gain access to resources that normally shouldn’t be accessible (privilege escalation) and modify system files.
Virus - A virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates and attaches itself to other executable files, such as a document, by inserting its own code. Most viruses require end-user interaction to initiate activation and can be written to act on a specific date or time.
Trojan Horse - This malware carries out malicious operations by masking its true intent. It might appear legitimate but is, in fact, very dangerous. Trojans exploit your user privileges and are most often found in image files, audio files or games.Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate but act as a decoy to sneak malicious software past unsuspecting users.
Worms - This is a type of malware that replicates itself in order to spread from one computer to another. Unlike a virus, which requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection of the host, they do not require user participation and can spread very quickly over the network.
Social engineering - Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
Denial-of-service - Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.
A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. 
Botnet - A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group
On-path attacks - On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices. Also called man in the middle or man in the mobile.
