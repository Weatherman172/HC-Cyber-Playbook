My name is Luke Horner. My career interest in cybersecurity is Security Analysis or Threat Hunting. I would like to get a security clearnece and work for some type of government or military entity. In 2018 I did a
nine month chemical operations certificate program. While in school, I was recruited by a resin manufactuaring plant in Columbus Ohio. I worked there as a chemical operator and a lab technician until 2021 which is
when I was injured by a massive explosion at work. After my 4 year recovery, I decided I would like to find a job with less explosions. Some of my hobbies include stock market trading, using my car racing simulator, 
showing my car at car shows, and golfing.
