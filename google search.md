The first thing that popped up was the worst thing that could have. A man with my name was arrested for meeting a 13 year old girl. I also found information about my lawsuit where i got hurt at work, plus some of
the videos and investigations from the explosion. I also found some of my racing results from where i used to race dirtbikes. The last thing I found was MX vs ATV the video game sharing one of my world records on
their game.
