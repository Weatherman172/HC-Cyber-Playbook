What is the role of networks in daily life?
Networks play a big role in daily life. Networks allow us to transfer sensitive data quickly and reliably. One of the most important ways is communication. Networks allow us to call, text, and email instantly. 
Another role is allowing online financial transactions on secured networks. This allows us to shop and bank online without disruptions. Social media networks also play a big role in most of our lives. I would say
majority of us spend hours a day on some sort of social media. Networks provide the digital infrasture for users to connect with others and share content.
